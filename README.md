# Bitcoin Pizza

I'm building an online restaurant to buy pizza with bitcoin!
The prices will have a fixed amount in $ but will be converted to the corresponding value in bitcoin according to its price at that time.
It will also have a delivery tracker and estimated arrival time.
The payments will be with normal methods too, but there will be a cashback program for the users who pays in bitcoin.
Depending on the amount of the purchase, they will receive certain number of ERC-20 tokens that will be created for this purpose.
The tokens will be used to obtain discounts on their orders.
